# Le Brows Premiére Website

This represents the culmination of our capstone project, a collaborative effort involving myself and two other team members. Our client was Le’ Brows Premieré, which is a business located in Kitchener, Ontario, that offers beauty services focused on eyebrows and lash treatments. 

The business was looking to improve their existing website, to include an online store, a section to offer training courses, and a streamlined booking system for scheduling appointments and services.

## Technologies used
The technologies used to develop this project were ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, ASP.NET Core Identity, Azure SQL Database, Bootstrap 5, xUnit, Moq, and Stripe integration as a payment gateway for the online store.
